    "*   **Observation:** The entire flight grid is sparser. Both the horizontal spacing along lines and the vertical spacing between lines have increased. The total number of waypoints is significantly reduced.\n",
    "*   **Reasoning:** Flying higher increases the ground area covered by each photo (the footprint). With constant overlap/sidelap percentages, the drone can travel further both forward and sideways between photos while still meeting the requirements.\n",
    "*   **Implication:** Flying higher covers ground faster with fewer photos, saving time and data. However, this comes at the cost of lower ground resolution (less detail) in the images.\n"

    "*   **Observation:** The plotted flight path (waypoint positions and density) appears identical to the baseline plan. However, the \"Capture Speed\" value displayed in the plot title has decreased dramatically.\n",
    "*   **Reasoning:** Exposure time dictates how long the camera shutter is open. It directly influences the maximum speed allowed *during* capture to avoid motion blur but does not affect the geometric layout (waypoint positions) needed to achieve the desired ground coverage and overlap.\n",
    "*   **Implication:** Longer exposure times (needed in low light) force the drone to fly much slower *at the moment of capture*, even if the path itself doesn't change. This can significantly increase the total mission duration compared to flying the same path in bright conditions with short exposures.\n"

    "*   **Observation:** The flight grid becomes extremely sparse. Both horizontal and vertical distances between waypoints are maximized, approaching the full size of the image footprint. Very few waypoints are generated.\n",
    "*   **Reasoning:** With very little required overlap, the drone can travel almost the full width/height of the area captured in one photo before needing to take the next one. This maximizes the spacing between waypoints.\n",
    "*   **Implication:** While drastically reducing photo count and flight time, such minimal overlap is insufficient for reliable map stitching or 3D model generation in photogrammetry. It demonstrates the lower limit of coverage but highlights why higher overlaps are standard practice for quality results.\n"

    "This project brought together camera modeling, flight planning, and data visualization for drone-based mapping. These are the main insights I gained:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Camera & Photogrammetry Basics:** I started with very little knowledge of camera optics or drone surveying. Building the pinhole camera model in code helped me understand how focal length and sensor size determine the ground footprint of each image, and why overlap between photos is essential for stitching and 3D reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Visual Feedback with Plotly:** Plotting the flight paths made the concepts click.Seeing how adjusting height or overlap changed the density and layout, reinforced the math behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **New Tools & Workflows:** This was my first project using:\n",
    "    *   **Jupyter Notebooks** for combining explanations, code, and plots.\n",
    "    *   **Plotly** for interactive, customizable visualizations.\n",
    "    *   **Git branches and Pull Requests** to manage development and code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, assembling the planner step by step and testing different parameters gave me practical experience in translating mathematical concepts into a working system—and in communicating results effectively through visualization."
